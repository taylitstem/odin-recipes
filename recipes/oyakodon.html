    <img src="../oyakodon.jpg" alt="japanese chicken and egg rice bowl" width="500" height="400">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>boneless chicken thighs or breasts cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 sweet onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken stock or dashi</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. soy sauce <i>or more</i></li>
        <li>1 tbsp. mirin</li>
        <li>1 tsp. maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup cooked rice <i>to serve</i></li>
        <li>green onion, sesame oil, nori <i>for garnish</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate chicken, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar in a bowl and set aside for 5-10 minutes while preparing the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>To prepare the egg mixture, crack the eggs into a bowl and gently break the yolks. You want to make sure the eggs are lightly beaten with the egg whites still visible.</li>
        <li>In a small pan, bring chicken stock to a boil over medium heat. Add onion and cook until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add the chicken mixture and cook for about 1-2 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>When the chicken is almost cooked through, pour the egg mixture evenly into the pan and cook for a few seconds until the edges are nearly set.</li>
        <li>Lightly scramble the eggs and cook for a few seconds more until the eggs are still a bit runny - the residual heat will continue to cook the eggs. Serve over a bowl of rice, garnish and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
